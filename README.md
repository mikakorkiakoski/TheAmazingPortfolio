## For review Examples

### HTML

### 1/5 Basic HTML structure is present.

![html1](reviewImages/html1.png)

### 2/5 HTML structure with clear content differentiation (headings, paragraphs, lists).

![html2](reviewImages/html2.png)

### 3/5 Use of forms, links, and media.

Forms and links are being used, i didn't need any media for my page but i added sound for successful message submit afterwards:

![html3](reviewImages/html3.png)
![mediass](reviewImages/mediass.png)

### 4/5 Tables are effectively used.

I didn't want to use tables in my Portfolio page, so teacher said to me that table can be made to different site to get a point from this review section. So here are the links for my table page: https://mikakorkiakoski.github.io/mikantable/ .
https://github.com/mikakorkiakoski/mikantable/blob/main/index.html .



### 5/5 Consistent use of semantic HTML throughout, ensuring better structure and understanding of the content. 
For example i use header and nav:

![html5](reviewImages/html5.png)

### CSS

### 1/5 Basic CSS styling (colors, fonts).
 Here's an example:

![css1](reviewImages/css1.png)

### 2/5 Use of classes and IDs to style specific elements. 
Example here:

![css2](reviewImages/css2.png)

### 3/5 Implementation of responsive design elements.
 You can check this with your mobile device when you go to my page. At least it works really well with Iphone 11.

![css3](reviewImages/css3.png)
![css3.3](reviewImages/css3.3.png)


### 4/5 Use of layouts for advanced user interfaces (arrays, float, flexbox, css grid)

In my works section i use grid, in services section i use grid, in about section i use flex and in navigation section i use flex.
My works section for example:

![css4](reviewImages/css4.png)

### 5/5 Styling demonstrates a strong grasp of layout principles, aesthetics, and user experience.
Yes my portfolio page is very nice when looking with computer and also with mobile-device:


![css5](reviewImages/css5.png)

### Javascript Basics

### 1/5 Simple interactions (like alerts on button click).
 For example here i have scroll up button and about me toggle section:

![js1](reviewImages/js1.png)

I also have function closemenu() onclick in navigation bar's href buttons so it always closes menu when navbar's buttons are clicked with mobile-device.

### 2/5 Multiple event listeners and basic DOM manipulations.
Here are 3 event listeners and if you just open app.js you can see every function is basically DOM manipulation.

![js2](reviewImages/js2.png)
![js2](reviewImages/js2.1.png)
![js2](reviewImages/js2.2.png)

### 3/5 Use of arrays, objects, and functions.
In the function opentab, tablinks and tabcontents are arrays.

![js3](reviewImages/js3.png)

There are many objects in app.js file, but here's one example, i use this object to create typing animation:

![js3.1](reviewImages/js3.1.png)

Previous screenshots should have revealed that there are multiple functions in app.js. You can also check the app.js file if you wish.

### 4/5 Advanced logic, looping through data, and dynamic DOM updates.
There is advanced logic and dynamic DOM updates in typing animation for example.

![js3.1](reviewImages/js3.1.png)

Also there is DOM update in 'Scroll to Top' button because it's visibility is dynamically
toggled based on the user's scroll position.

![js4](reviewImages/js4.png)



I also loop through data in 'opentab' function to loop through all elements with the 
class 'tablinks' using the 'for...'of' loop, represented by 'tablink'.

![js4.2](reviewImages/js4.2.png)

### 5/5 Consistent use of Object-Oriented JavaScript principles.
I created an object from 'Typed' constructor and assigned it to variable called 'typed'. I got this object from external library shown in the end of index.html file. Another instances of object-oriented programming principles that are being used are var tablinks and var tabcontents that are using HTMLCollection to return elements with the specified class name. Also there is HTMLDivElement objects being used when i want to access and modify the styles and properties of DOM elements, such as
ScrollToTopButton.style.display = "block"; If this is not enough to get a point, i definitely fill the review criterias of this section in another program to get a point from this section, which you can check out with following links: https://mikakorkiakoski.github.io/javascripttehtava1/

### Asynchronous Operations

### 1/5 Use of timers.
 I use timers when i want to reset message sending form and wipe the message after 5 seconds that is being displayed if message is successfully sended or not.


![ao1](reviewImages/ao1.png)

### 2/5 Successful implementation of an AJAX call or Fetch.
 From the latest image you can see that there is a successful implementation of Fetch.


### 3/5 Data from the asynchronous call is displayed on the webpage.
While the data fetched is not directly displayed on the webpage, the user receives feedback on the form submission result and it also informs when data is being sended. On the other hand, i can see the message and message sender's name and email that is submitted with contact form in google sheet with this code:

![ao1](reviewImages/contactformcode.png)

Here's what the sheet looks like:

![ao1](reviewImages/googlesheet.png)

If this is not enough, teacher said that the course's objectives can also be made to another website to get point. So here are the links where i fetch NASA's picture of the day to my another portfolio in the news section!: https://github.com/mikakorkiakoski/javascripttehtava4/blob/main/pictureoftheday.js .
https://mikakorkiakoski.github.io/javascripttehtava4/news.html



### 4/5 Error handling is implemented (for failed API calls, etc.).
 Error handlings are implemented in message form submission.

### 5/5 Effective use of asynchronous data to enhance user experience (like filtering, sorting).

I don't GET any asynchronous data to my webpage with asynchronous calls and i don't even have any data i would need to GET. I only POST asynchronous data to my sheet with call. To enhance user experience in the sheet, my program puts name, email, and message to their own sections and to their own lines. Also as i said, when asynchronous call is being made, the user can see when fetch call is posting to sheet, and the user can see when posting is successful or not.
