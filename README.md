## For review Examples

### HTML

### 1/5 Basic HTML structure is present.

![html1](reviewImages/html1.png)

### 2/5 HTML structure with clear content differentiation (headings, paragraphs, lists).

![html2](reviewImages/html2.png)

### 3/5 Use of forms, links, and media.

Forms and links are being used, i didn't need any media for my page but i added sound for successful message submit afterwards:

![html3](reviewImages/html3.png)
![mediass](reviewImages/mediass.png)

### 4/5 Tables are effectively used.

I don't have any tabular data yet.

### 5/5 Consistent use of semantic HTML throughout, ensuring better structure and understanding of the content. 
For example i use header and nav:

![html5](reviewImages/html5.png)

### CSS

### 1/5 Basic CSS styling (colors, fonts).
 Here's an example:

![css1](reviewImages/css1.png)

### 2/5 Use of classes and IDs to style specific elements. 
Example here:

![css2](reviewImages/css2.png)

### 3/5 Implementation of responsive design elements.
 You can check this with your mobile device when you go to my page. At least it works really well with Iphone 11.

![css3](reviewImages/css3.png)
![css3.3](reviewImages/css3.3.png)


### 4/5 Use of layouts for advanced user interfaces (arrays, float, flexbox, css grid)

In my works section i use grid, in services section i use grid, in about section i use flex and in navigation section i use flex.
My works section for example:

![css4](reviewImages/css4.png)

### 5/5 Styling demonstrates a strong grasp of layout principles, aesthetics, and user experience.
Yes my portfolio page is very nice when looking with computer and also with mobile-device:


![css5](reviewImages/css5.png)

### Javascript Basics

### 1/5 Simple interactions (like alerts on button click).
 For example here i have scroll up button and about me toggle section:

![js1](reviewImages/js1.png)

### 2/5 Multiple event listeners and basic DOM manipulations.
Here are 3 event listeners and if you just open app.js you can see every function is basically DOM manipulation.

![js2](reviewImages/js2.png)
![js2](reviewImages/js2.1.png)
![js2](reviewImages/js2.2.png)

### 3/5 Use of arrays, objects, and functions.
In the function opentab, tablinks and tabcontents are arrays of elements selected by their class names.

![js3](reviewImages/js3.png)

In the typing animation there is object called 'Typed'

![js3.1](reviewImages/js3.1.png)

Previous screenshots should have revealed that there are multiple functions in app.js. You can also check the file if you wish.

### 4/5 Advanced logic, looping through data, and dynamic DOM updates.
There is advanced logic and dynamic DOM updates in typing animation for example.

![js3.1](reviewImages/js3.1.png)

Also there is DOM update in 'Scroll to Top' button because it's visibility is dynamically
toggled based on the user's scroll position.

![js4](reviewImages/js4.png)



I also loop through data in 'opentab' function to loop through all elements with the 
class 'tablinks' using the 'for...'of' loop, represented by 'tablink'.

![js4.2](reviewImages/js4.2.png)

### 5/5 Consistent use of Object-Oriented JavaScript principles.
As i said i use 'Typed' object as a constructor. Another instances of object-oriented programming principles that are being used are var tablinks and var tabcontents that are using HTMLCollection to return elements with the specified class name. Also there is HTMLDivElement objects being used when i want to access and modify the styles and properties of DOM elements, such as
ScrollToTopButton.style.display = "block";

### Asynchronous Operations

### 1/5 Use of timers.
 I use timers when i want to reset message sending form and wipe the message after 5 seconds that is being displayed if message is successfully sended or not.


![ao1](reviewImages/ao1.png)

### 2/5 Successful implementation of an AJAX call or Fetch.
 From the latest image you can see that there is a successful implementation of Fetch.


### 3/5 Data from the asynchronous call is displayed on the webpage.
While the data fetched is not directly displayed on the webpage, the user receives feedback on the form submission result.


### 4/5 Error handling is implemented (for failed API calls, etc.).
 Error handlings are implemented in message form submission.

### 5/5 Effective use of asynchronous data to enhance user experience (like filtering, sorting).

no.
